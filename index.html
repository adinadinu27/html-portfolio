    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is Adina and I currently work in the gambling industry, as a Gaming Operations Executive. More specifically,
        I take care of launching new games on the online casino's website, including everything that happens in the background:
        adding games to the backoffice, making sure they work etc.
    
    </p>
    <p>I started this position about 3 months ago and I can say that I really like what I do.</p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I have graduated High School, having studied Sciences, and started university, in the International
        Affairs domain, but never finished it, because I decided to dedicate myself to my career. However,
        this year, I have decided to go back to University to get my degree.
